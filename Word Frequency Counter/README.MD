# Word Frequency Counter

This project was developed for the course INF01203 Data Structures - C class at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. The goal of the project is to create a C algorithm that receives three input files via command line and count the frequency that each word appears in one of the files, taking into account the operations requested in the operations text file.

This project aims to apply the knowledge acquired during the course, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, different types of binary trees, and to evaluate the performance obtained using different data structures to perform the same operation.

## Introduction

In this section, we describe the purpose of the project, which is to create an algorithm to count the frequency that each word appears in one of the input files. We also explain the motivation behind the project and how it relates to the course.

## Functions

This section presents the functions created to operate and organize the code of the project. We explain in detail the role of each function, such as imprime_apresentacao(), which prints the project information, and contador(), which counts the frequency that each word appears in the input file.
