# INF01203 - Data Structures

This is a repository containing the assignments and projects for the Data Structures course taught by Professor Renata Galante at UFRGS. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work and progress throughout the course.

## About the Course

Data Structures is a fundamental course in the Computer Engineering curriculum at UFRGS. It covers a variety of topics related to data structures, algorithms, and their implementation in different programming languages.

The course is designed to provide students with a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations of data structures, as well as practical skills in implementing and analyzing algorithms and data structures. It also aims to help students develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities through hands-on projects and assignments.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains all the projects and assignments completed during the course. Each project is contained in a separate folder, with its own README file explaining the purpose, implementation details, and expected output.

The assignments and projects cover a wide range of topics, such as:
- Linked lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms

All projects are implemented in C++, and some may include additional libraries or dependencies.

## How to Use This Repository

If you are also taking the Data Structures course at UFRGS or a similar course elsewhere, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for studying and learning. You can browse through the different projects and assignments, examine the code, and try to implement similar solutions yourself.

If you are a potential employer or recruiter, this repository can provide insight into my skills and experience with data structures and algorithms. You can review the code and assess my ability to design, implement, and analyze different data structures and algorithms.
