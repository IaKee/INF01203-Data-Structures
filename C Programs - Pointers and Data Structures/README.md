# C Programming Assignments

This folder contains various C programming assignments completed by me while studying data structures in my computer engineering program. The assignments in this folder were completed on my own time, outside of class.

## Contents

- adress_value_test_2.c: a program that tests pointer arithmetic by incrementing and decrementing a pointer variable.
- memory_allocation_sruct.c: a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for a struct.
- memory_allocation_struct_values.c: a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for an array of structs and initializes the values.
- memory_allocation_test.c: a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for an integer array and initializes the values.
- memory_allocation_test_2.c: a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for an integer array and initializes the values using a for loop.
- pointer_data_log.c: a program that demonstrates pointer usage by printing the memory addresses and values of variables.
- pointer_pratice.c: a program that practices pointer usage by performing various operations on pointer variables.
- adress_test.c: a program that tests pointer usage by printing the memory addresses and values of variables.
- adress_value_after_malloc.c: a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for an integer variable and prints its memory address and value.
- adress_value_test.c: a program that tests pointer usage by printing the memory addresses and values of variables.

Each program includes comments explaining the code's functionality and implementation details.

## How to Use

To run any of these programs, compile the code with `gcc` or another C compiler, and then run the resulting executable. The specific compilation commands are included in each file's comments.
